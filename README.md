Hello world.

I'm just another person on the internet, pursuing my hobbies both on and off the world wide web.

Learning new things is one of my addictions! But I have to be totally captivated by an idea before I go on a new learning quest.

Past and Ongoing learning quests:

Learning to read, write and speak Mandarin
Learning to skate and play ice hockey
Learning to sew
Learning to build a canoe
Learning to practice yoga and meditation
Learning to follow my internal infradian rhythm
Learning to set-up a website
The last item is the main reason why I have this account, so that I can create a github page, and showcase my hobbies and learning quests on a blog of my very own. Thanks for reading about me! Always interested in intelligent engagement. If you have something worthwhile to say, lets chat!
